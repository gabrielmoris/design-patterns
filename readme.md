# SOLID design Principles

It is a set of design principles introduced by Robert C. Martin.

### Single Responsability Principle.

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

[EXAMPLE of Single Responsability Principle](SOLID-design-principles/single-responsibility-principle.js)

### Open Closed Principle

It states that software entities (like classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the devs should be able to add new features without changing existing code.

[EXAMPLE of Open Closed Principle](SOLID-design-principles/open-closed-principle.js)
