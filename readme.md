# SOLID design Principles

It is a set of design principles introduced by Robert C. Martin.

### Single Responsability Principle.

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

[EXAMPLE of Single Responsability Principle](SOLID-design-principles/single-responsibility-principle.js)

### Open Closed Principle

It states that software entities (like classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the devs should be able to add new features without changing existing code.

[EXAMPLE of Open Closed Principle](SOLID-design-principles/open-closed-principle.js)

### Liskov Substitution Principle

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
In JavaScript, this means that a subclass should be able to extend a parent class and be used interchangeably without introducing errors or changing the expected behavior.

[EXAMPLE of Liskov Substitution Principle](SOLID-design-principles/liskov-substitution-principle.js)
